\chapter{DCC Interpreter}

\section{Interpreter}

Whereas the original grammar for the DCC abstract machine presents sequences as values, it has an implicit semantics that is unpacked in the implementation details. Here, we present sequences as expressions and define their semantics explicitly as:

\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{definition}[Semantics of a sequence of continuations]
\item Let $D_i$ denote some term with a hole and $D_i[v]$ denote the term $D_i$ with the hole filled by $v4$:
\[
\begin{array}{rclr}
  \langle 
    (D_1:D_2:\dots:D_n) ,
    D^\prime,
    E,
    q
  \rangle 
    &\Rightarrow&
  \langle 
    `lx.D_n[D_{n-1}[\ \dots D_1[x]\dots ]],
    D^\prime,
    E,
    q
  \rangle 
\end{array}
\]
\end{definition}
