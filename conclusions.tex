\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Type preservation} -- check whether types are preserved across the translations
  \item \emph{Haskell extensio} -- write a general purpose, language-level extension for named exceptions in Haskell
  \item \emph{Reimplement DCC without stack} -- The implementation of \lmu\ in DCC only ever uses a single prompt: DCC is overengineered for the purposes of a \lmu-translation. Rewrite DCC using a mapping from prompts to contexts.
\end{itemize}
