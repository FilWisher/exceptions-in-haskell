\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Firstly, I want to say thank you to Steffen van Bakel for his steady reassurance,
for directing my excitement into productive channels of inquiry,
and -- most importantly -- for bringing me in from the cold, 
into the warm shelter of formal proofs, 
type theory, 
and computational calculi.
I would like to thank Rafe for getting me excited about maths and the \lam-calculus, 
for wandering through the darkness with me, 
and for helping me find intuitions when all I could find were headaches.   
I would like to thank Caitlin for always keeping me happy and sane, 
and for reminding me to look after myself.
Thank you (and sorry) to my parents for their patience with me, I'm sure this has been just as hard for them.
